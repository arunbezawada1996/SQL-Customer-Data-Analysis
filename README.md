This project provides a comprehensive SQL-based reporting framework for analyzing **Sales, Customers, and Products** within a modern data warehouse environment. 

It utilizes a combination of fact and dimension tables (Kimball-style star schema) to deliver key business intelligence metrics such as:

- **Change-over-time sales trends** (daily, monthly, yearly)
- **Cumulative sales analysis**
- **Year-over-year product performance comparison**
- **Customer segmentation** (VIP, Regular, New)
- **Product segmentation** (High-Performer, Mid-Range, Low-Performer)
- **Part-to-whole category contribution**
- **Detailed customer and product reports with key KPIs**

The SQL scripts are modular, well-documented, and designed to support both **operational reporting** and **strategic decision-making**. They can easily be integrated into BI tools such as Power BI, Tableau, or Looker.
